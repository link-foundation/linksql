# LinksQL

LinksQL is an associative query language and reference implementation built
around a **single substitution operation**. It aims to be as customizable as
[GraphQL](https://graphql.org), yet simpler, more universal, and more adaptive —
in the spirit of [link-cli](https://github.com/link-foundation/link-cli).

Where GraphQL needs separate query, mutation, and subscription type systems,
LinksQL expresses **read, create, update, and delete** with one operation:
pairing a _restriction_ (what to match) with a _substitution_ (what it becomes).

```
(restriction) (substitution)
```

That single rule is Turing-complete (it is a Markov algorithm over an
associative store), so it scales from one-line reads to complex multi-pattern
rewrites without new syntax.

## Data model: links and doublets

Everything is a **link** — an ordered pair stored as `(index: source target)`,
where `index`, `source`, and `target` are positive integers referring to other
links. A link that points at itself, `(i: i i)`, is a **point** — the atom of
the model. This is the _doublet_ associative model used across
[deep-foundation](https://github.com/deep-foundation) and
[link-foundation](https://github.com/link-foundation).

Links are written and parsed with **Links Notation (LiNo)**:

```
(1: 1 1)            // a point with index 1
(3: 1 2)            // link 3 connects 1 -> 2
((alice loves) bob) // names auto-create as points; doublets nest for arity > 2
($i: $s $t)         // $-prefixed tokens are variables for matching
(*: * *)            // * is a wildcard that matches anything
```

Because a link has exactly two endpoints, every pattern carries **0 or 2
values** (an optional `index:` prefix aside). Higher-order relations are built by
nesting: "alice loves bob" is `((alice loves) bob)` — the link `(alice loves)` is
itself the source of a link whose target is `bob`. A flat `(alice loves bob)` is
rejected: _a link pattern must have 0 or 2 values_.

## The single substitution operation

A query is a restriction pattern followed by a substitution pattern. The two
sides are paired positionally, and the difference between them determines the
operation:

| Query shape                       | Operation  | Meaning                                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `(pattern)`                       | **read**   | match without mutating                 |
| `() ((a b))`                      | **create** | substitution with no restriction       |
| `((a b)) ((a c))`                 | **update** | rewrite matches in place, keeping ids  |
| `((a b)) ()`                      | **delete** | restriction with no substitution       |
| multiple pairs of differing kinds | **mixed**  | several substitutions in one statement |

Every execution returns a structured `QueryReport`:

```js
{
  operation: 'update',
  matched:  [{ links: [...], binding: { s: 1, t: 2 } }],
  created:  [],
  updated:  [{ index: 3, source: 1, target: 4 }],
  deleted:  []
}
```

## Quick start

LinksQL has **zero runtime dependencies** — the library uses only the
JavaScript standard library, the server uses `node:http`, and the client uses
the global `fetch` (Node.js 20+, Bun, Deno, and browsers).

### Install

```bash
npm install @link-foundation/linksql
```

### Use as a library

```js
import { createDatabase } from '@link-foundation/linksql';

const db = createDatabase();

// CREATE — names auto-create as points; doublets nest for arity > 2
db.query('() (((alice loves) bob))');

// READ — variables bind to matching links
const read = db.query('(($i: $s $t))');
console.log(read.matched.map((m) => m.binding));

// UPDATE — rewrite in place, keeping the link id
db.query('(((alice loves) bob)) (((alice loves) carol))');

// DELETE — trailing empty substitution removes the match
db.query('(((alice loves) carol)) ()');

// INTROSPECT — the LinksQL answer to a GraphQL schema
console.log(db.introspect());
```

See [`js/examples/basic-usage.js`](js/examples/basic-usage.js) for a runnable
version, and [`js/examples/schema-server.js`](js/examples/schema-server.js) for
the GraphQL-class schema layer in action.

### Use the CLI

```bash
# Run a query against an in-memory store
npx linksql query '() ((1 1))'

# Persist to a LiNo file between invocations with --db
npx linksql query '() (((alice loves) bob))' --db links.lino
npx linksql query '(($i: $s $t))' --db links.lino

# Import / export the whole store as Links Notation
npx linksql export --db links.lino
npx linksql import other.lino --db links.lino

# Serve the HTTP API
npx linksql serve --port 4000
```

### Use the HTTP server and client

```js
import { startServer, LinksQLClient } from '@link-foundation/linksql';

const server = await startServer({ port: 4000 });

const client = new LinksQLClient('http://localhost:4000');

// Subscriptions stream changes filtered by a restriction (GraphQL
// subscriptions, replaced by Server-Sent Events over the same operation).
const sub = client.subscribe('(($i: $s $t))', (event) => {
  console.log('changed:', event.operation, event.matching);
});
await sub.ready;

await client.query('() (((alice loves) bob))');

sub.close();
await server.close();
```

### Define an API with a schema

LinksQL ships a **GraphQL-class schema layer**: a schema — itself written in
Links Notation — declares types, typed relations (`from` → `to` edges), named
queries (reusable reads) and named subscriptions (live feeds). `createSchemaServer`
turns a schema into a running API with a `/schema` introspection endpoint (the
GraphQL `__schema` analogue), `POST /query/<name>` for named queries and
`GET /subscribe/<name>` for named subscriptions.

```js
import { createSchemaServer, LinksQLClient } from '@link-foundation/linksql';

const schema = `(schema social
  (type Person)
  (type Post)
  (relation name (from Person) (to Text))
  (relation likes (from Person) (to Post))
  (query everyone (($p: $p $p)))
  (subscription newLikes ((1 $post))))`;

const server = await createSchemaServer(schema, { version: '1.0.0' });
const client = new LinksQLClient(server.url);

const doc = await client.schema(); // introspection document
console.log(doc.types, doc.scalars); // ['Person','Post'] ['Text']

const report = await client.runNamed('everyone'); // run a named query
await server.close();
```

See [`js/examples/schema-server.js`](js/examples/schema-server.js) for a runnable
version. Any relation endpoint that is not a declared `type` (here `Text`) is
inferred as a **scalar**, exactly like GraphQL's leaf types.

## Wire protocol: Links Notation everywhere

Links Notation is not only the surface syntax for queries — it is the **data
transfer protocol**. Every structured value that crosses the network (query
reports, link lists, the introspection/schema documents, subscription events)
travels as Links Notation text with the `application/lino` content type. Inside a
process the engine works with plain JSON-shaped objects; a single boundary built
on [`lino-objects-codec`](https://github.com/link-foundation/lino-objects-codec)
converts between the two:

```js
import { encode, decode } from '@link-foundation/linksql';

const wire = encode({ operation: 'read', matched: [] });
// "((operation read) (matched ()))" — Links Notation, not JSON
const value = decode(wire); // back to a plain object
```

The server and client negotiate content: `application/lino` is the default, and
JSON is an opt-in convenience for plain browsers that send `Accept:
application/json`. When a request advertises both, Links Notation wins.

## Reference implementations

The single specification, [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/SPECIFICATION.md), is
backed by four behaviourally identical implementations so LinksQL can be adopted
from any of the targeted ecosystems:

| Language   | Directory | Tests & lint                           |
| ---------- | --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| JavaScript | `js/`     | `npm test`, ESLint + Prettier          |
| Rust       | `rust/`   | `cargo test`, `clippy`, `rustfmt`      |
| Python     | `python/` | `pytest`, `ruff`, `mypy`               |
| C#         | `csharp/` | `dotnet test` (xUnit), `dotnet format` |

Each implementation provides the same parser, store, substitution engine, and
query executor. The JavaScript package additionally ships the HTTP server,
client, and CLI described above.

## Specification

The full language reference — data model, Links Notation grammar, the
substitution algorithm, operation classification, introspection, subscriptions,
and triggers — lives in [`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`](docs/SPECIFICATION.md). All
implementations are validated against it.

## Multi-runtime support

The JavaScript implementation works identically on every major runtime, using
[test-anywhere](https://github.com/link-foundation/test-anywhere) for a unified
testing API:

- **Bun**: `bun test --timeout 30000`
- **Node.js**: `npm test` (`node --test --test-timeout=30000`)
- **Deno**: `deno test --allow-read`

## Example app

[`js/examples/universal-app`](js/examples/universal-app) is a Vite + React
playground that imports the LinksQL query executor from `js/src/query.js` and runs
the single substitution operation against an in-memory database in the browser.
The same static build is reused by three targets:

- GitHub Pages (`npm run example:web:build`)
- Electron desktop packaging (`npm run example:desktop:package`)
- Capacitor Android/iOS sync (`npm run example:mobile:sync`)

It imports `js/src/query.js` directly (never `js/src/index.js`) so the Node-only
HTTP server stays out of the browser bundle. See
[`js/examples/universal-app/README.md`](js/examples/universal-app/README.md) for
local web, desktop, Android, and iOS testing instructions.

### Auto-regenerated preview screenshots

The `example-app.yml` workflow contains a `preview-regen` job that boots the
built example app in a headless Chromium via
[`browser-commander`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/browser-commander) +
Playwright and writes fresh screenshots to
`js/docs/screenshots/example-app/example-app-{locale}-{theme}.png` on every push to
`main` (and on `workflow_dispatch`). Any drift is committed back to `main` with
`[skip ci]` so README/site images never go stale between releases. The job runs
in the official Playwright container with the browser already installed,
avoiding CI stalls from live Chromium downloads.

The same script is available locally:

```bash
cd js
npm install --prefix examples/universal-app
npm run example:web:preview-images
# Verbose probe of <html data-theme>, <html lang>, and PNG signatures:
PREVIEW_VERBOSE=1 npm run example:web:preview-images
```

## CI/CD pipeline

Each implementation has its own path-filtered workflow that only runs when files
in its directory (or the workflow itself) change, so a Rust-only change never
spends CI minutes on the JavaScript matrix:

| Workflow                         | Triggers on    | Fast-fail stages                                                        |
| -------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`js.yml`](.github/workflows/js.yml)         | `js/**`       | lint/format/duplication/line-limits → test (3 runtimes × 3 OS) → publish |
| [`rust.yml`](.github/workflows/rust.yml)     | `rust/**`     | `cargo fmt` + `clippy` → `cargo test` + doctests → publish               |
| [`python.yml`](.github/workflows/python.yml) | `python/**`   | `ruff` + `mypy` → `pytest` (3 Python versions) → publish                 |
| [`csharp.yml`](.github/workflows/csharp.yml) | `csharp/**`   | `dotnet format` → `dotnet test` (Release) → publish                      |

Two repository-wide workflows run on any matching change:

- [`links.yml`](.github/workflows/links.yml) — checks every Markdown/HTML link
  with [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee) (case studies excluded).
- [`example-app.yml`](.github/workflows/example-app.yml) — builds the universal
  example app and refreshes its preview screenshots.

**Release** (on push to `main`): each language workflow compares its manifest
version against the registry and publishes only if that version is new, then
creates a language-prefixed GitHub release. See
[docs/CONTRIBUTING.md](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning-and-releases) for the
version-bump convention and [docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md](docs/BEST-PRACTICES.md) for
detailed explanations of each practice.
